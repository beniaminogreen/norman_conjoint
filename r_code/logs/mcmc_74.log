Loading required package: Rcpp
This is rstanarm version 2.21.3
- See https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors for changes to default priors!
- Default priors may change, so it's safest to specify priors, even if equivalent to the defaults.
- For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
  options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
This is cmdstanr version 0.5.2
- CmdStanR documentation and vignettes: mc-stan.org/cmdstanr
- CmdStan path: /home/beniamino/.cmdstan/cmdstan-2.30.0
- CmdStan version: 2.30.0
This is bayesplot version 1.9.0
- Online documentation and vignettes at mc-stan.org/bayesplot
- bayesplot theme set to bayesplot::theme_default()
   * Does _not_ affect other ggplot2 plots
   * See ?bayesplot_theme_set for details on theme setting
This is loo version 2.5.1
- Online documentation and vignettes at mc-stan.org/loo
- As of v2.0.0 loo defaults to 1 core but we recommend using as many as possible. Use the 'cores' argument or set options(mc.cores = NUM_CORES) for an entire session.

Warning in '/tmp/RtmpkX5QGF/model-51b38f119e.stan', line 5, column 2: Declaration
    of arrays by placing brackets after a variable name is deprecated and
    will be removed in Stan 2.32.0. Instead use the array keyword before the
    type. This can be changed automatically using the auto-format flag to
    stanc

Running MCMC with 4 parallel chains...

Chain 2 Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Chain 2 Exception: normal_lpdf: Location parameter[1] is -nan, but must be finite! (in '/tmp/RtmpkX5QGF/model-51b38f119e.stan', line 55, column 2 to column 38)
Chain 2 If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
Chain 2 but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
