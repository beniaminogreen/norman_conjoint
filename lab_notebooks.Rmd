# Notes 25/05/22 and Before

## Cleaned Data

Created `/r_code/clean.R` to clean and save raw data from the survey to to
cleaned files. Wrote in unit tests to ensure no observations are dropped, and
that columns are correct.

I created two datasets, `data/full_ratio.parquet` and `data/full_conjoint.parquet` that
contain all the information on the ratio-level questions (where the answer is
1-6), and the conjoint questions (where the answer is which unit a respondent
prefers). The ratio dataset has twice the number of rows that the conjoint
question has.
